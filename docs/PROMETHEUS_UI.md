# Prometheus UI: The Interface for Cognitive Collaboration

Prometheus is the human-facing layer of Mnemosyne — where memory, prediction, and adaptation become interactive.

---

## 🔮 What It Enables

- **Thought Continuity**: Resume where you left off — days or weeks ago
- **Context-Aware Workflows**: Interface adapts based on your habits and timing
- **Predictive Preparation**: Surfaces what you’re likely to need before you request it
- **Cognitive Alignment**: Prometheus becomes more effective the more you use it

---

## 🖼 Concept View

Imagine:
- A spatial workspace where documents, charts, and notes persist in location
- Mnemosyne whispering: “Here’s that comparison you always look at on Fridays”
- A timeline of memory threads you can scroll and re-enter

---

## 🎨 Design Principles

- **Clarity over Control**: Let the system do what it knows — but always let the user guide
- **Memory as Workspace**: Instead of opening and closing files, you traverse cognitive frames
- **Temporal Awareness**: Recency, repetition, rhythm = behaviorally informed UX
- **Symbiosis, Not Assistance**: It’s not a bot. It’s a collaborator.

## 🧭 Current Status

In UI prototyping and design.  
First milestone: a memory-aware notes + timeline canvas.
