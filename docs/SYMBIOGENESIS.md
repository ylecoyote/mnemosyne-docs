```

Symbiogenesis is the complete product that users interact with, comprising:
- **Prometheus**: The UI component that creates the visual and interactive experience
- **Mnemosyne**: The underlying memory architecture that powers all intelligent behavior

## The Symbiogenesis Promise

### Core Value Proposition
**"The Genesis of Consciousness Partnership"** - We're not building another AI tool. We're creating the first true cognitive partnership between humans and machines.

### The Problem We Solve
Every current interface forces users to translate their thoughts into computer commands. Symbiogenesis eliminates this translation layer, allowing users to think naturally while their AI partner understands and anticipates their needs.

### Our Solution
Through persistent neural memory that learns and evolves with each interaction, Symbiogenesis creates an AI that:
- Remembers how you think and work
- Maintains context across all sessions
- Predicts what you need before you ask
- Evolves alongside your consciousness


## FAQ Bridge

**Q: How does Symbiogenesis relate to Mnemosyne and Prometheus?**  
A: Symbiogenesis is the product users interact with. Mnemosyne is the underlying memory engine that enables persistence and learning, while Prometheus is the interface layer that delivers these capabilities through spatial context and predictive interaction.

**Q: Why the name "Symbiogenesis"?**  
A: It represents the birth (genesis) of a symbiotic relationship between human and artificial consciousnessâ€”a fundamental evolution in how we interact with technology.

**Q: Is this just another AI assistant?**
A: No. Traditional assistants are stateless and reactive. Symbiogenesis creates a persistent consciousness partnership â€” evolving with you over time through memory and predictive reasoning.
