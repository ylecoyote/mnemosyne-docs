# ðŸ”¥ Prometheus â€” The Interface of Symbiogenesis

Prometheus is the user-facing component of Symbiogenesis â€” where memory, prediction, and adaptation become **interactive and visual**.

ðŸ’¡ Powered by [Mnemosyne](./MNEMOSYNE.md), the neural memory system that learns, recalls, and evolves through each user interaction.

> **"The machine thinks with you."**  
> Prometheus is not a dashboard. Itâ€™s a spatial, predictive interface that aligns with your cognition.  
> Itâ€™s powered by Mnemosyne â€” a memory system that learns how your mind works.

## ðŸ§  What It Enables

- **Thought Continuity** â€” Resume where you left off, weeks later
- **Context-Aware Workflows** â€” Interface adapts to your habits and time of day
- **Predictive Preparation** â€” Surfaces what you need *before* you ask
- **Cognitive Alignment** â€” Grows more attuned the more you use it

```plaintext
User: Can you show me how this compares to last quarter?
Symbiogenesis: Here's the comparison chart. I noticed youâ€™re 72% above projections in the midwest region, so Iâ€™ve preloaded a breakdown by product line. 
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Principles

- **Clarity over Control**  
  Let the system actâ€”but keep user trust
- **Memory as Workspace**  
  You move through time and context, not files
- **Temporal Awareness**  
  Recency, rhythm, repetition = UX
- **Symbiosis, Not Assistance**  
  Not a chatbot. A co-thinker.

## ðŸ§­ Current Status

Prometheus is currently in interface prototyping and UX iteration.  
The team is building:

- A spatial layout engine for memory-driven interfaces  
- Predictive context surfacing based on intent and time of day  
- Feedback-aware interface loops that grow more aligned over time

ðŸ§© **Milestone**: Launch alpha workspace UI with predictive thread recall

*Symbiogenesis is not just a tool.  
It is the interface that learns how your mind works â€” and evolves with your consciousness.*
