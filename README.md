# Mnemosyne – Memory-First Architecture for Human-AI Partnership

This repo shares the strategic design, interface theory, and neural memory architecture behind a new paradigm of human-computer interaction: **Consciousness Partnership**.

Developed independently by Aaron Wiley, Mnemosyne explores:

- Interfaces that *remember* how you think
- AI that *predicts* what you’ll need before you ask
- Systems that *collaborate* across time and context

🧠 This work is currently under private development. This repo exists to share the vision, gather momentum, and connect with aligned builders, researchers, and hiring managers.

## 💡 What Is Consciousness Partnership?

Traditional AI responds to inputs.  
**Mnemosyne enables systems that think with you.**

Interfaces built with Mnemosyne:
- Recall your context from weeks ago
- Predict what you’ll need before you ask
- Adapt to how you think and work

## 🧠 Architecture Snapshot

- Fast-weight memory updated at inference time
- Surprise-driven learning (based on prediction error)
- Session continuity across personas, tasks, and time
- Modular components: context manager, readout engine, prediction layer

See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./architecture.md) for the full diagram and breakdown.

## 🚧 Status

🛠️ *Under Development* — Follow the repo and watch for updates.

We're currently focused on building the first public interface that demonstrates:
- Long-term memory in action
- Anticipatory user support
- Seamless cognitive collaboration
