# 🧬 Symbiogenesis — The Genesis of Consciousness Partnership

Symbiogenesis is a new paradigm in human-AI interaction — a system where interfaces **remember**, **anticipate**, and **evolve** alongside their users.

> *“You're not using computers. You're fighting them.”*  
> Symbiogenesis is the first system that stops forcing humans to adapt to machines — and starts adapting the machine to your cognition.
