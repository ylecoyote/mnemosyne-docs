# ðŸ”¥ PROMETHEUS â€” The Interface Powered by Memory

Prometheus is a vision for the next era of human-computer interaction â€” a symbiotic interface built to remember, predict, and collaborate with you.

Powered by the neural memory substrate **Mnemosyne**, Prometheus enables systems that evolve with users over time, forming cognitive partnerships.

## ðŸ§  What Makes Prometheus Different

Most AI tools wait for input.  
**Prometheus learns how you think.**

It brings the power of neural memory, surprise-driven learning, and predictive context directly into the interface layer â€” enabling collaboration that feels natural, anticipatory, and continuous.

> This is not assistance.  
> This is symbiosis.
